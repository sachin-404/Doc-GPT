      "\u001b[0m\"Rectal bleeding (known medically as hematochezia) refers to the passage of red blood from the anus, often mixed with stool and/or blood clots.It is called rectal bleeding because the rectum lies immediately above the anus, but red blood in the stool may be coming from the rectum, as discussed later, but it also may be coming from other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. The first step in the care of cuts and scrapes (abrasions) is to stop the bleeding. Most wounds respond to direct pressure with a clean cloth or bandage. Hold the pressure continuously for approximately 10 to 20 minutes. If this fails to stop the bleeding or if the bleeding is rapid, seek medical assistance. Clean the wound. An anal fissure is a cut or tear occurring in the anus (the opening through which stool passes out of the body) that extends upwards into the anal canal. Fissures are a common condition of the anus and anal canal and are responsible for 6% to 15% of the visits to a colon and rectal surgeon.They affect men and women equally and both the young and the old. A hematoma is an abnormal collection of blood outside of a blood vessel. It occurs because the wall of a blood vessel wall, artery, vein, or capillary, has been damaged and blood has leaked into tissues where it does not belong. The hematoma may be tiny, with just a dot of blood, or it can be large and cause significant swelling. Symptoms of the inflammation of the colon lining include diarrhea, pain, and blood in the stool. There are several causes of colitis, including infection, ischemia of the colon, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, infectious colitis like C. difficile, or microscopic colitis). Treatment depends on the cause of the ...\"\n",

There are a few different options available, depending on the severity of the wound. If the wound is minor, you can try using an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment. If the wound is more serious, you may need to see a doctor for prescription medication. Some common medications used to treat cut wounds include:\n\n* Betaine/polyhexanide: This is a topical medication that is used to cleanse and moisten acute and chronic skin wounds, and to promote healing of the wounds.\n* Dibucaine topical ointment: This is a local anesthetic that is used to relieve the pain and itching of sunburn, cuts, abrasions, insect bites, skin irritation, and hemorrhoids.\n* Neomycin/polymyxin B/bacitracin/pramoxine: This is an antibiotic ointment topically applied on minor cuts, scrapes, burns, and wounds to prevent infection and relieve pain.\n\nIf you are not sure which medication is right for you, please speak to a doctor.`"
